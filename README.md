# ReactReduxUnitTestSandbox
- Little sandbox app to showcase some real life unit test scenarios for each part of a react redux app w/ hooks
- Using the aspnet core react/redux template so that I also get a little demo API
- Mainly for reference for myself for react component unit testing, but if you've come across this the actual react code is under the 'ReactReduxUnitTestSandbox/ClientApp' folder of the project
- Note: i'm still working on it if your wondering why there's only 1 test file done >.<

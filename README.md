# ReactReduxUnitTestSandbox
- Little sandbox app to showcase some real life unit test scenarios for each part of a react redux app w/ hooks
- Using the aspnet core react/redux template so that I also get a little demo API
- Mainly for reference for myself for react component unit testing, but if you've come across this the actual react code is under the 'ReactReduxUnitTestSandbox/ClientApp' folder of the project (under the todo feature folder) for a basic demo of:
	- Redux action tests with mock HTTP via axios-mock-adapter
	- Simple component rendering tests w/ enzyme
	- A redux connected component using the useSelector hook rendering tests with enzyme
	- Reducer tests

( Test spec files located under ReactReduxUnitTestSandbox/ReactReduxUnitTestSandbox/ClientApp/src/todos )
